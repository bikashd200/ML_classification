# ML_classification
Classification using deep learning and classical ML techniques

This Code is written by:
## Bikash Debnath

## Purpose:
This code will allow to build a classicication model using classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Requirements 

1. Python 3.x
2. RDKit
3. TensorFlow
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib

The code is optimized to run on Google Colab Pro.

## Dataset
Example dataset is from ChEMBL DB: HER2 actives (HER2-actives.smi) and inactives (HER2-inactives.smi).
There are 1,684 actives and 2,258 incatives

## Deep learning model
The notebook "HER2_classification_DL.ipynb" is for develop deep learning model.

## Classical machine learning model
Will be uploaded soon
